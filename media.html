          <p>if you've ever sat through a sex ed class you'll know this much. the media influences how we think about sex and gender.
          and you've probably heard about all the negative influences it can have on us, and that's true. there are negatives, and
          there are positives as well. that being said though, we're not here to talk about either. we're here to talk about the media
          and it's influences on gender, and the lgbt+ community as a whole.</p>

          <p>so, LGBT+ people in the media. this is both a very big issue, and a very small issue at the same time.
            while gay people in the media are pretty well represented, the media still fails to provide a full
            and accurate representation of the members of the LGBT+ community, as well as the variety of types of people
            in the LGBT community. for example. think of a lesbian shown in the media. that's easy, right? we've got hannah
            hart and ellen for one. and if you're like me you can think of lexa, and alex danvers, and every single character
            that katie mcgrath has ever played. but, i have a question for you, what do all of these women have in common?
            answer? they're all somewhat butch, and they're all white.</p>
            <p>moving on, think of gay men in the media, if you're like me
            you can name a plethora of them who break the stereotypes as you watch star trek on repeat. but most people will probably
            hit will and grace, that kid from glee, and neil patrick harrison. and i'm going to ask you to name the common thread between
            all thse men. have you picked up on it again? for the most part they're all white, and they're all very obviously
            gay. okay.</p>
            <p>now one more experiment. name a fictional transgender character. are you still trying to think of one?
            don't worry. i can only come up with lord fanny and alysia yeoh. both of whom are obscure comic book characters. beneath
            all of this lay a lot of issues in lgbt+ media representation that you ought to be aware of before you have sex, or come out.
            let's start with the obvious one.</p>

            <b style="font-size:20px;">the overview</b>
            <p>so media really affects how we look at ourselves, and how other people look at us. media can help shape, or change,
            your identity and your opinions about yourself. and the media's influence on the lbgt+ community can be no less understated.
            while there are plenty of lgbt+ characters in the media, rarely are they a main character, and only very recently has that
            been getting better. but for years before gay characters were meant as jokes and people to be laughed at and made fun of.
            a large part of this reason has been because of the media.
            </p>
            <p>so what makes up the media? well first of all? books, tv shows, news papers, movies, and basically anyway you can get
              information from. historically societies haven't been tollerate of lgbt+ people, and this has led to the media often
              disparaging which then led to the people disliking them even more, creating a somewhat endless cycle. lgbt+ people have
              been persecuted as criminals, labeled mentally ill and more. all of this stems from a so called 'normal' which has bee
              established by the poeple. this idea of normal is supposed to reflect what's 'right' often meaning a heterosexual couple
              in a nuclear family. it is, however, because of these opinions, that being lgbt+ still has such a stigma about it.
              the beliefs, policies, and media representation all stems from the idea that heteronormativity is 'normal' and therefore
              'right' attatching a stigma to being lgbt+ as the people also believe that it's the 'right' and 'better' way to be.</p>
            <p>it's because of this that we've shapped our beliefs of lgbt+ people. we've grouped ourselves into the binaries of
              male and female, and that straight is right and lgbt+ is wrong, and this, in the end, has led to a somewhat toxic culture
              in many ways, like men who think they can't cry, and girls who are told they can't become engineers. all of this stems
              from a heteronormative society where we place our gender roles and being straight over being happy and being who you
              want to be. there are a lot of other ways that the media's influenced lgbt+ culture, and i hope you'll stick around
              for the rest of them.</p>

            <b style="font-size:20px;">butch, femme, and other gender representations for gay's, lesbians and bisexuals.</b>
            <p>hollywood has a major issue mainly concerning the representation of lgbt+ people in the media, that being that
              they're often sloted into small boxes and not allowed to explore much outside of them, it's rare to see a character
              who isn't fully in one category or another, and this has led to a lot of issues for the lgbt+ community, one of those
              being 'the question.' it's a question almost every person in a same sex relationship has had to answer. 'so, which one
              of you is the girl/boy?'</p>
              <p>this idea of a 'girl/boy' is a myth that persists in according to many people, about lgbt+ couples. that there has to
                be a dominate partner in the relationship, but that's just simply untrue. in any relationship what so ever, there never
                needs to be one person who calls all the shots. however, the media persists with this idea, coding many characters in a
              same sex relationship with one as the 'female', and one as the 'male.' even in glee, daren criss plays the more 'masculine'
              partner, even proposing, and the other kid plays the much more 'feminine' partner, squealing over clothing and fashion
              at almost every given chance. while this isn't necessarily bad, because it gives all the people who do fit into these
              subgroups a way to look at themselves, it's also harmful because it provides representations of LGBT+ people when a large
              amount of the population probably doesn't fit into these boxes. so, media affects us a lot. it creates stereotypes that, while
              maybe there, certainly aren't true for everyone. don't force yourself into these boxes, and keep in mind that you can be whatever
              you wish.</p>

              <b style="font-size:20px;">intersectionality + lgbt people in the media.</b>
              <p>name a queer poc in the media. have you thought of one? i can count four. two women from 'orange is the new black', the
                awesome lesbian from 'black lightning' -- the one who makes earthquakes -- and
              my man crush's -- henry shum jr's -- role in <i>shadowhunters</i> and while both of these are awesome. Let's break it down.
              those two women? They're both black, and it takes place in a prison. then we go onto our awesome lesbian from 'black lightening'
              i've got very little complaints about her actually. she's a PhD, superhero, and activist. the one thing? she always seems to be
              flirting with whomever has just come her way. and then we've got henry shum jr. his character is oversexualised, which is a whole
              big issue with asian characters in the media that we just won't get into. either which way, the peple in the happiest relationships
              either ooze sex, or have been in prison. and that doesn't say a lot about how to be poc and lgbt+. it says we either have to look
              in desperate places or be sex obssed to some extent, and this is not the representation that is good, or needed of any memebers of
              the lgbt+ community. more than that though? that's only four people i can count. counting more? that's hard, and that's not good
              there are asian and black and latina people who are lgbt+, and yet they are disproportionatly represented in the media, and then
              when they're shown it falls into stereotypes of their ethnicity and of being gay. this representation needs to end. while yes, it's
              good that there are poc lgbt+ people in the media, their representation is far from good, and needs to be improved on. immediately.</p>

              <b style="font-size:20px;">let's talk about you and me.</b>
              <p>smexy times. or sex. whatever you want to call it. it's getting down dirty and low, and the media's got an issue with doing
              a good job of portraying it. i mean, the basis line of this bit is, don't learn how to fuck by watching television. that's not a
              good idea. hetero or gay. just don't. it's far from right. the media has an odd obbsession with both scissoring and fake dildo's
              and while both of those are used, believing that those are the only ways two women have sex is so wrong, it's a tiny bit impressive.
              there are a lot more ways to have sex between people with the same genetilia. and we'll talk about that later. but basically?
              please don't watch porn to learn how to have sex. it's inaccurate, and your so who may have had sex before will only be like 'what
              the somehow actual fuck?'</p>
