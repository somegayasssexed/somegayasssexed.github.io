        <div class ="container">
          <p>so you're curious about sexuality. according to GLSEN sexuality is
            <blockquote>'an enduring emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction
                that one feels toward men, toward women, or toward both. Although sexual
                orientation ranges along a continuum, it is generally discussed in terms of
                heterosexual—attraction to the other sex—homosexual—attraction to the same
                sex—and bisexual—attraction to both sexes'</blockquote></p>
              <p>what this then means is that sexuality isn't just a black and white thing, where
              you're into the opposite sex or not, it's a whole plethora of things. you could be
              mostly into girls and occasionally into boys, or half and half. or you could normally
              not like either, but sometimes be into girls. really, sexuality is however you want
              to define it for <i>YOU.</i></p>
              <p><br><b>why do people have different sexualities?</b></p>
              <p>so yeah. not everyone's sexuality's the same. there're a lot of theories on why
                members of the LGBTQIA+ community exist, and these theories range from genetic pre-determination
                to childhood trauma. however, despite all of this, there's no straight up answer, and
                no single cause has been identified, and there seems to be no way to actually change
                it despite so called 'gay conversion' therapies, which are considered immoral by many
                different organisations. keep in mind that, despite no scientific edvidence for why people might
                be gay, doesn't your sexuality is wrong or unnatural, because while we don't have an explination for being gay, we also
                don't have one for being straight. so get comfortable in your own skin! you're here for the
                long run.</p>
              <p>But just in case you're curious and you have some more
              questions that need to be answered, this guide comes with a handy list of terminology
              for all your curious needs.</p>
