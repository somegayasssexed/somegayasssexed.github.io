          <p><br>so... sex. you've probably heard about it, and if you haven't you're <i>way</i> too young to be on this
            website. sex is traditionally defined as when a dude puts his penius in a woman's vagina. but, if you're
            here you know that, and that doesn't feel quite right for you. and that's alright. it doesn't have to feel
            right or wrong for you at all. sex is whatever you make it to be at the end of the day, so let's get started.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

          </div>

          <div class="opher">
            <p>first, how about we redefine sex a bit here. the traditional definition of sex according to the online oxford
              dictionary is:
              <blockquote>Sexual contact between individuals involving penetration, especially the insertion of a man's erect penis into a
                woman's vagina, typically culminating in orgasm and the ejaculation of semen.</blockquote>
            <p>but if you're on here that maybe doesn't sound quite right to you, and don't worry! that is perfectly natural and
              perfectly okay. let's instead make this a bit different than it is. first of all, there are women with penius's and
              people who have no gender, but have em too. so let's change that to 'person's', and on the same note, let's change 'woman's'
              to 'person's' as well. now this reads</p>
              <blockquote>Sexual contact between individuals involving penetration, especially the insertion of a person's erect penis into a
                peron's vagina, typically culminating in orgasm and the ejaculation of semen.</blockquote>
            <p>in my mind that still doesn't feel quite right. we've got penetration and two terms which still imply a man and a woman together.
              can't two women be sexing it up? on that note?</p>
              <blockquote>Sexual contact between individuals, for heteronormative couples this often is the insertion of a man's erect penis
                into a woman's vagina, typically culminating in orgasm and the ejaculation of semen, however, it can also consist of any form
                of sexual gratification for one or more of the people engaging in sexual intercourse.</blockquote>
            <p>this means that sex <i>DOESN'T</i> have to be between a man and a woman, it can be between anyone and however
              many people who want, it doesn't need to include a penius, or a vagina or whatever. as i said before, it can
              with whatever and with whomever, you want. in the end, this website is meant to help clarify a lot of things surrounding
              sex in the lgbt community to help YOU have better, healthier, and safer sex. as well as just straight up know
              however the hell this shit works anyways.<br>
              good luck!<br>
